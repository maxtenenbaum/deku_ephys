# Deku Neural Data Processing

## Description

We are working to design a program to process and analyze the electrophysiological signals being recorded in the Deku Lab at the University of Oregon. Given the use of experimental thin-film devices, having code that can be modified to understand better the data being recorded is of utmost importance.
## Getting Started
